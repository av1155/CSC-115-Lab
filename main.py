# With a hashtag you can make comments. A cool thing about Python is that it is very easy to understand for beginners. I have linked all of this to my GitHub repository and I am able to save my work on the cloud this way. Wage, hours, and weeks are all expressions because they yield a value. In this case, they yield the values, 20, 8, and 52. Then you can use the expression "salary" to get a result. In this new expression you can write down that wage * hours * weeks = the new salary. Print is used to print text and then show the result. In this case, I "print" the new salary.
